# Read and clean data
```{r}
catch_original <- read.csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1", method="libcurl"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
#head(catch_original)
```

Remove 'all' column and 'notes' column because we don't need them.
```{r}
  catch_data <- catch_original %>% 
    select(-All, -notesRegCode)
```

# Fix Chinook column
Use 'mutate' to fix the column, as it contains non-numeric values

```{r}
  catch_clean <- catch_data %>%
    mutate(Chinook = ifelse(Chinook=="I", 1, Chinook)) %>%
    mutate(Chinook = as.numeric(Chinook))
#    mutate(chinook = as.numeric(Chinook))
```
# Find rows being turned into NA
#```{r}
#  i <- which(is.na(catch_clean$chinook))
#  i
#```

# Reshape data
```{r}
  catch_long <- catch_clean %>%
    pivot_longer(cols=-c(Region, Year), 
                names_to = "Species",
                values_to = "Count")
  head(catch_long)
```

```{r}
  catch_wide <- catch_long %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = Year,
                values_from = Count)
  head(catch_wide)
```

'rename' Count column to 'catch_thousand'
```{r}
  catch_long <- catch_long %>%
    rename(catch_thousand = Count) %>%
    mutate(catch = catch_thousand * 1000) %>%
    select(-catch_thousand)
  head(catch_long)
```

# Summarize data

```{r}
  mean_region <- catch_long %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarize(total_catch=sum(catch), catch_mean = mean(catch), num_obs=n())
  head(mean_region)
```


# Join to a region table
